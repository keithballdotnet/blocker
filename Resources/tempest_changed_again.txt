Master. Boatswain!
Boatswain. Here, master: what cheer?
Master. Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely, 5
or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.
[Exit]

[Enter Mariners]

Boatswain. Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! 
yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the 10
master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind, 
if room enough! 
[Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND,] 
GONZALO, and others]
Alonso. Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master? 15
Play the men.
Boatswain. I pray now, keep below.
Antonio. Where is the master, boatswain?
Boatswain. Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your 
cabins: you do assist the storm. 20
Gonzalo. Nay, good, be patient.
Boatswain. When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers 
for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.
Gonzalo. Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
Boatswain. None that I more love than myself. You are a 25
counsellor; if you can command these elements to 
silence, and work the peace of the present, we will 
not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you 
cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make 
yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of 30
the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out 
of our way, I say.
[Exit]

Gonzalo. I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he 
hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is 35
perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his 
hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable, 
for our own doth little advantage. If he be not 
born to be hanged, our case is miserable.
[Exeunt]

[Re-enter Boatswain]

Boatswain. Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring 
her to try with main-course. 
[A cry within] 
A plague upon this howling! they are louder than 45
the weather or our office. 
[Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO] 
Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er 
and drown? Have you a mind to sink?
Sebastian. A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, 50
incharitable dog!
Boatswain. Work you then.
Antonio. Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker! 
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
Gonzalo. I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were 55
no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an 
unstanched wench.
Boatswain. Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to 
sea again; lay her off.
[Enter Mariners wet]

Mariners. All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!
Boatswain. What, must our mouths be cold?
Gonzalo. The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them, 
For our case is as theirs.
Sebastian. I'm out of patience. 65
Antonio. We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards: 
This wide-chapp'd rascal—would thou mightst lie drowning 
The washing of ten tides!
Gonzalo. He'll be hang'd yet, 
Though every drop of water swear against it 70
And gape at widest to glut him. 
[A confused noise within: 'Mercy on us!'—] 
'We split, we split!'—'Farewell, my wife and 
children!'— 
'Farewell, brother!'—'We split, we split, we split!'] 75
Antonio. Let's all sink with the king.
Sebastian. Let's take leave of him.
[Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN]

Gonzalo. Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an 
acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any 80
thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain 
die a dry death.
[Exeunt]

 	     	
Act I, Scene 2

The island. Before PROSPERO’S cell.

     	 
[Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA]

Miranda. If by your art, my dearest father, you have 85
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them. 
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, 
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek, 
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered 
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel, 90
Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her, 
Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock 
Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd. 
Had I been any god of power, I would 
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere 95
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and 
The fraughting souls within her.
Prospero. Be collected: 
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart 
There's no harm done. 100
Miranda. O, woe the day!
Prospero. No harm. 
I have done nothing but in care of thee, 
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who 
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing 105
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better 
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell, 
And thy no greater father.
Miranda. More to know 
Did never meddle with my thoughts. 110
Prospero. 'Tis time 
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand, 
And pluck my magic garment from me. So: 
[Lays down his mantle] 
Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort. 115
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd 
The very virtue of compassion in thee, 
I have with such provision in mine art 
So safely ordered that there is no soul— 
No, not so much perdition as an hair 120
Betid to any creature in the vessel 
Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down; 
For thou must now know farther.
Miranda. You have often 
Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd 125
And left me to a bootless inquisition, 
Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'
Prospero. The hour's now come; 
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear; 
Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember 130
A time before we came unto this cell? 
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not 
Out three years old.
Miranda. Certainly, sir, I can.
Prospero. By what? by any other house or person? 135
Of any thing the image tell me that 
Hath kept with thy remembrance.
Miranda. 'Tis far off 
And rather like a dream than an assurance 
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not 140
Four or five women once that tended me?
Prospero. Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it 
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else 
In the dark backward and abysm of time? 
If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here, 145
How thou camest here thou mayst.
Miranda. But that I do not.
Prospero. Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since, 
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and 
A prince of power. 150
Miranda. Sir, are not you my father?
Prospero. Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and 
She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father 
Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir 
And princess no worse issued. 155
Miranda. O the heavens! 
What foul play had we, that we came from thence? 
Or blessed was't we did?
Prospero. Both, both, my girl: 
By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence, 160
But blessedly holp hither.
Miranda. O, my heart bleeds 
To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to, 
Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.
Prospero. My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio— 165
I pray thee, mark me—that a brother should 
Be so perfidious!—he whom next thyself 
Of all the world I loved and to him put 
The manage of my state; as at that time 
Through all the signories it was the first 170
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed 
In dignity, and for the liberal arts 
Without a parallel; those being all my study, 
The government I cast upon my brother 
And to my state grew stranger, being transported 175
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle— 
Dost thou attend me?
Miranda. Sir, most heedfully.
Prospero. Being once perfected how to grant suits, 
How to deny them, who to advance and who 180
To trash for over-topping, new created 
The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em, 
Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key 
Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state 
To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was 185
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk, 
And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.
Miranda. O, good sir, I do.
Prospero. I pray thee, mark me. 
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated 190
To closeness and the bettering of my mind 
With that which, but by being so retired, 
O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother 
Awaked an evil nature; and my trust, 
Like a good parent, did beget of him 195
A falsehood in its contrary as great 
As my trust was; which had indeed no limit, 
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded, 
Not only with what my revenue yielded, 
But what my power might else exact, like one 200
Who having into truth, by telling of it, 
Made such a sinner of his memory, 
To credit his own lie, he did believe 
He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution 
And executing the outward face of royalty, 205
With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing— 
Dost thou hear?
Miranda. Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
Prospero. To have no screen between this part he play'd 
And him he play'd it for, he needs will be 210
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library 
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties 
He thinks me now incapable; confederates— 
So dry he was for sway—wi' the King of Naples 
To give him annual tribute, do him homage, 215
Subject his coronet to his crown and bend 
The dukedom yet unbow'd—alas, poor Milan!— 
To most ignoble stooping.
Miranda. O the heavens!
Prospero. Mark his condition and the event; then tell me 220
If this might be a brother.
Miranda. I should sin 
To think but nobly of my grandmother: 
Good wombs have borne bad sons.
Prospero. Now the condition. 225
The King of Naples, being an enemy 
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit; 
Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises 
Of homage and I know not how much tribute, 
Should presently extirpate me and mine 230
Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan 
With all the honours on my brother: whereon, 
A treacherous army levied, one midnight 
Fated to the purpose did Antonio open 
The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness, 235
The ministers for the purpose hurried thence 
Me and thy crying self.
Miranda. Alack, for pity! 
I, not remembering how I cried out then, 
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint 240
That wrings mine eyes to't.
Prospero. Hear a little further 
And then I'll bring thee to the present business 
Which now's upon's; without the which this story 
Were most impertinent. 245
Miranda. Wherefore did they not 
That hour destroy us?
Prospero. Well demanded, wench: 
My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not, 
So dear the love my people bore me, nor set 250
A mark so bloody on the business, but 
With colours fairer painted their foul ends. 
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark, 
Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared 
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd, 255
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats 
Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us, 
To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh 
To the winds whose pity, sighing back again, 
Did us but loving wrong. 260
Miranda. Alack, what trouble 
Was I then to you!
Prospero. O, a cherubim 
Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile. 
Infused with a fortitude from heaven, 265
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt, 
Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me 
An undergoing stomach, to bear up 
Against what should ensue.
Miranda. How came we ashore? 270
Prospero. By Providence divine. 
Some food we had and some fresh water that 
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo, 
Out of his charity, being then appointed 
Master of this design, did give us, with 275
Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries, 
Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness, 
Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me 
From mine own library with volumes that 
I prize above my dukedom. 280
Miranda. Would I might 
But ever see that man!
Prospero. Now I arise: 
[Resumes his mantle] 
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow. 285
Here in this island we arrived; and here 
Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit 
Than other princesses can that have more time 
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.
Miranda. Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir, 290
For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason 
For raising this sea-storm?
Prospero. Know thus far forth. 
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune, 
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies 295
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience 
I find my zenith doth depend upon 
A most auspicious star, whose influence 
If now I court not but omit, my fortunes 
Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions: 300
Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness, 
And give it way: I know thou canst not choose. 
[MIRANDA sleeps] 
Come away, servant, come. I am ready now. 
Approach, my Ariel, come. 305
[Enter ARIEL]

Ariel. All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come 
To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly, 
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride 
On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task 310
Ariel and all his quality.
Prospero. Hast thou, spirit, 
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?
Ariel. To every article. 
I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak, 315
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin, 
I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide, 
And burn in many places; on the topmast, 
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly, 
Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors 320
O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary 
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks 
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune 
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble, 
Yea, his dread trident shake. 325
Prospero. My brave spirit! 
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil 
Would not infect his reason?
Ariel. Not a soul 
But felt a fever of the mad and play'd 330
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners 
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel, 
Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand, 
With hair up-staring,—then like reeds, not hair,— 
Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty 335
And all the devils are here.'
Prospero. Why that's my spirit! 
But was not this nigh shore?
Ariel. Close by, my master.
Prospero. But are they, Ariel, safe? 340
Ariel. Not a hair perish'd; 
On their sustaining garments not a blemish, 
But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me, 
In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle. 
The king's son have I landed by himself; 345
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs 
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting, 
His arms in this sad knot.
Prospero. Of the king's ship 
The mariners say how thou hast disposed 350
And all the rest o' the fleet.
Ariel. Safely in harbour 
Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once 
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew 
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid: 355
The mariners all under hatches stow'd; 
Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour, 
I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet 
Which I dispersed, they all have met again 
And are upon the Mediterranean flote, 360
Bound sadly home for Naples, 
Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd 
And his great person perish.
Prospero. Ariel, thy charge 
Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work. 365
What is the time o' the day?
Ariel. Past the mid season.
Prospero. At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now 
Must by us both be spent most preciously.
Ariel. Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains, 370
Let me remember thee what thou hast promised, 
Which is not yet perform'd me.
Prospero. How now? moody? 
What is't thou canst demand?
Ariel. My liberty. 375
Prospero. Before the time be out? no more!
Ariel. I prithee, 
Remember I have done thee worthy service; 
Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served 
Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise 380
To bate me a full year.
Prospero. Dost thou forget 
From what a torment I did free thee?
Ariel. No.
Prospero. Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze 385
Of the salt deep, 
To run upon the sharp wind of the north, 
To do me business in the veins o' the earth 
When it is baked with frost.
Ariel. I do not, sir. 390
Prospero. Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot 
The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy 
Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?
Ariel. No, sir.
Prospero. Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me. 395
Ariel. Sir, in Argier.
Prospero. O, was she so? I must 
Once in a month recount what thou hast been, 
Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax, 
For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible 400
To enter human hearing, from Argier, 
Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did 
They would not take her life. Is not this true?
Ariel. Ay, sir.
Prospero. This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child 405
And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave, 
As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant; 
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate 
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands, 
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee, 410
By help of her more potent ministers 
And in her most unmitigable rage, 
Into a cloven pine; within which rift 
Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain 
A dozen years; within which space she died 415
And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans 
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island— 
Save for the son that she did litter here, 
A freckled whelp hag-born—not honour'd with 
A human shape. 420
Ariel. Yes, Caliban her son.
Prospero. Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban 
Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st 
What torment I did find thee in; thy groans 
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts 425
Of ever angry bears: it was a torment 
To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax 
Could not again undo: it was mine art, 
When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape 
The pine and let thee out. 430
Ariel. I thank thee, master.
Prospero. If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak 
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till 
Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.
Ariel. Pardon, master; 435
I will be correspondent to command 
And do my spiriting gently.
Prospero. Do so, and after two days 
I will discharge thee.
Ariel. That's my noble master! 440
What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?
Prospero. Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject 
To no sight but thine and mine, invisible 
To every eyeball else. Go take this shape 
And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence! 445
[Exit ARIEL] 
Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!
Miranda. The strangeness of your story put 
Heaviness in me.
Prospero. Shake it off. Come on; 450
We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never 
Yields us kind answer.
Miranda. 'Tis a villain, sir, 
I do not love to look on.
Prospero. But, as 'tis, 455
We cannot miss him: he does make our fire, 
Fetch in our wood and serves in offices 
That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban! 
Thou earth, thou! speak.
Caliban. [Within] There's wood enough within. 460
Prospero. Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee: 
Come, thou tortoise! when? 
[Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph] 
Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel, 
Hark in thine ear. 465
Ariel. My lord it shall be done.
[Exit]

Prospero. Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself 
Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!
[Enter CALIBAN]

Caliban. As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd 
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen 
Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye 
And blister you all o'er!
Prospero. For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps, 475
Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins 
Shall, for that vast of night that they may work, 
All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd 
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging 
Than bees that made 'em. 480
Caliban. I must eat my dinner. 
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother, 
Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first, 
Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me 
Water with berries in't, and teach me how 485
To name the bigger light, and how the less, 
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee 
And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle, 
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile: 
Cursed be I that did so! All the charms 490
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you! 
For I am all the subjects that you have, 
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me 
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me 
The rest o' the island. 495
Prospero. Thou most lying slave, 
Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee, 
Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee 
In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate 
The honour of my child. 500
Caliban. O ho, O ho! would't had been done! 
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else 
This isle with Calibans.
Miranda. Abhorred slave, 
Which any print of goodness wilt not take, 505
Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee, 
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour 
One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage, 
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like 
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes 510
With words that made them known. But thy vile race, 
Though thou didst learn, had that in't which 
good natures 
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou 
Deservedly confined into this rock, 515
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.
Caliban. You taught me language; and my profit on't 
Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you 
For learning me your language!
Prospero. Hag-seed, hence! 520
Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best, 
To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice? 
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly 
What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps, 
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar 525
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.
Caliban. No, pray thee. 
[Aside] 
I must obey: his art is of such power, 
It would control my dam's god, Setebos, 530
and make a vassal of him.
Prospero. So, slave; hence! 
[Exit CALIBAN] 
[Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing;] 
FERDINAND following] 535
ARIEL'S song. 
Come unto these yellow sands, 
And then take hands: 
Courtsied when you have and kiss'd 
The wild waves whist, 540
Foot it featly here and there; 
And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear. 
Hark, hark! 
[Burthen [dispersedly, within] Bow-wow] 
The watch-dogs bark! 545
[Burthen Bow-wow] 
Hark, hark! I hear 
The strain of strutting chanticleer 
Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.
Ferdinand. Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth? 550
It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon 
Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank, 
Weeping again the king my father's wreck, 
This music crept by me upon the waters, 
Allaying both their fury and my passion 555
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it, 
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone. 
No, it begins again. 
[ARIEL sings] 
Full fathom five thy father lies; 560
Of his bones are coral made; 
Those are pearls that were his eyes: 
Nothing of him that doth fade 
But doth suffer a sea-change 
Into something rich and strange. 565
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell 
[Burthen Ding-dong] 
Hark! now I hear them,—Ding-dong, bell.
Ferdinand. The ditty does remember my drown'd father. 
This is no mortal business, nor no sound 570
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.
Prospero. The fringed curtains of thine eye advance 
And say what thou seest yond.
Miranda. What is't? a spirit? 
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir, 575
It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.
Prospero. No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses 
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest 
Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd 
With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him 580
A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows 
And strays about to find 'em.
Miranda. I might call him 
A thing divine, for nothing natural 
I ever saw so noble. 585
Prospero. [Aside] It goes on, I see, 
As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee 
Within two days for this.
Ferdinand. Most sure, the goddess 
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer 590
May know if you remain upon this island; 
And that you will some good instruction give 
How I may bear me here: my prime request, 
Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder! 
If you be maid or no? 595
Miranda. No wonder, sir; 
But certainly a maid.
Ferdinand. My language! heavens! 
I am the best of them that speak this speech, 
Were I but where 'tis spoken. 600
Prospero. How? the best? 
What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?
Ferdinand. A single thing, as I am now, that wonders 
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me; 
And that he does I weep: myself am Naples, 605
Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld 
The king my father wreck'd.
Miranda. Alack, for mercy!
Ferdinand. Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan 
And his brave son being twain. 610
Prospero. [Aside]. The Duke of Milan 
And his more braver daughter could control thee, 
If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight 
They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel, 
I'll set thee free for this. 615
[To FERDINAND] 
A word, good sir; 
I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.
Miranda. Why speaks my father so ungently? This 
Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first 620
That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father 
To be inclined my way!
Ferdinand. O, if a virgin, 
And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you 
The queen of Naples. 625
Prospero. Soft, sir! one word more. 
[Aside] 
They are both in either's powers; but this swift business 
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning 
Make the prize light. 630
[To FERDINAND] 
One word more; I charge thee 
That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp 
The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself 
Upon this island as a spy, to win it 635
From me, the lord on't.
Ferdinand. No, as I am a man.
Miranda. There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple: 
If the ill spirit have so fair a house, 
Good things will strive to dwell with't. 640
Prospero. Follow me. 
Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come; 
I'll manacle thy neck and feet together: 
Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be 
The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks 645
Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.
Ferdinand. No; 
I will resist such entertainment till 
Mine enemy has more power.
[Draws, and is charmed from moving]

Miranda. O dear father, 
Make not too rash a trial of him, for 
He's gentle and not fearful.
Prospero. What? I say, 
My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor; 655
Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience 
Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward, 
For I can here disarm thee with this stick 
And make thy weapon drop.
Miranda. Beseech you, father. 660
Prospero. Hence! hang not on my garments.
Miranda. Sir, have pity; 
I'll be his surety.
Prospero. Silence! one word more 
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What! 665
An advocate for an imposter! hush! 
Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he, 
Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench! 
To the most of men this is a Caliban 
And they to him are angels. 670
Miranda. My affections 
Are then most humble; I have no ambition 
To see a goodlier man.
Prospero. Come on; obey: 
Thy nerves are in their infancy again 675
And have no vigour in them.
Ferdinand. So they are; 
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up. 
My father's loss, the weakness which I feel, 
The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats, 680
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me, 
Might I but through my prison once a day 
Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth 
Let liberty make use of; space enough 
Have I in such a prison. 685
Prospero. [Aside] It works. 
[To FERDINAND] 
Come on. 
Thou hast done well, fine Ariel! 
[To FERDINAND] 690
Follow me. 
[To ARIEL] 
Hark what thou else shalt do me.
Miranda. Be of comfort; 
My father's of a better nature, sir, 695
Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted 
Which now came from him.
Prospero. Thou shalt be free 
As mountain winds: but then exactly do 
All points of my command. 700
Ariel. To the syllable.
Prospero. Come, follow. Speak not for him.
[Exeunt]

 	     	
Act II, Scene 1

Another part of the island.

     	 
[Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO,] [p]ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others]

Gonzalo. Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause, 
So have we all, of joy; for our escape 
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe 
Is common; every day some sailor's wife, 
The masters of some merchant and the merchant 710
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle, 
I mean our preservation, few in millions 
Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh 
Our sorrow with our comfort.
Alonso. Prithee, peace. 715
Sebastian. He receives comfort like cold porridge.
Antonio. The visitor will not give him o'er so.
Sebastian. Look he's winding up the watch of his wit; 
by and by it will strike.
Gonzalo. Sir,— 720
Sebastian. One: tell.
Gonzalo. When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd, 
Comes to the entertainer—
Sebastian. A dollar.
Gonzalo. Dolour comes to him, indeed: you 725
have spoken truer than you purposed.
Sebastian. You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
Gonzalo. Therefore, my lord,—
Antonio. Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
Alonso. I prithee, spare. 730
Gonzalo. Well, I have done: but yet,—
Sebastian. He will be talking.
Antonio. Which, of he or Adrian, for a good 
wager, first begins to crow?
Sebastian. The old cock. 735
Antonio. The cockerel.
Sebastian. Done. The wager?
Antonio. A laughter.
Sebastian. A match!
Adrian. Though this island seem to be desert,— 740
Sebastian. Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.
Adrian. Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,—
Sebastian. Yet,—
Adrian. Yet,—
Antonio. He could not miss't. 745
Adrian. It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate 
temperance.
Antonio. Temperance was a delicate wench.
Sebastian. Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.
Adrian. The air breathes upon us here most sweetly. 750
Sebastian. As if it had lungs and rotten ones.
Antonio. Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.
Gonzalo. Here is everything advantageous to life.
Antonio. True; save means to live.
Sebastian. Of that there's none, or little. 755
Gonzalo. How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
Antonio. The ground indeed is tawny.
Sebastian. With an eye of green in't.
Antonio. He misses not much.
Sebastian. No; he doth but mistake the truth totally. 760
Gonzalo. But the rarity of it is,—which is indeed almost 
beyond credit,—
Sebastian. As many vouched rarities are.
Gonzalo. That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in 
the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and 765
glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with 
salt water.
Antonio. If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not 
say he lies?
Sebastian. Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report 770
Gonzalo. Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we 
put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of 
the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
Sebastian. 'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.
Adrian. Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to 775
their queen.
Gonzalo. Not since widow Dido's time.
Antonio. Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in? 
widow Dido!
Sebastian. What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord, 780
how you take it!
Adrian. 'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that: 
she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.
Gonzalo. This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
Adrian. Carthage? 785
Gonzalo. I assure you, Carthage.
Sebastian. His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath 
raised the wall and houses too.
Antonio. What impossible matter will he make easy next?
Sebastian. I think he will carry this island home in his pocket 790
and give it his son for an apple.
Antonio. And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring 
forth more islands.
Gonzalo. Ay.
Antonio. Why, in good time. 795
Gonzalo. Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now 
as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage 
of your daughter, who is now queen.
Antonio. And the rarest that e'er came there.
Sebastian. Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido. 800
Antonio. O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.
Gonzalo. Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I 
wore it? I mean, in a sort.
Antonio. That sort was well fished for.
Gonzalo. When I wore it at your daughter's marriage? 805
Alonso. You cram these words into mine ears against 
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never 
Married my daughter there! for, coming thence, 
My son is lost and, in my rate, she too, 
Who is so far from Italy removed 810
I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir 
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish 
Hath made his meal on thee?
Francisco. Sir, he may live: 
I saw him beat the surges under him, 815
And ride upon their backs; he trod the water, 
Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted 
The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head 
'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd 
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke 820
To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd, 
As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt 
He came alive to land.
Alonso. No, no, he's gone.
Sebastian. Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss, 825
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter, 
But rather lose her to an African; 
Where she at least is banish'd from your eye, 
Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.
Alonso. Prithee, peace. 830
Sebastian. You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise 
By all of us, and the fair soul herself 
Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at 
Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your 
son, 835
I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have 
More widows in them of this business' making 
Than we bring men to comfort them: 
The fault's your own.
Alonso. So is the dear'st o' the loss. 840
Gonzalo. My lord Sebastian, 
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness 
And time to speak it in: you rub the sore, 
When you should bring the plaster.
Sebastian. Very well. 845
Antonio. And most chirurgeonly.
Gonzalo. It is foul weather in us all, good sir, 
When you are cloudy.
Sebastian. Foul weather?
Antonio. Very foul. 850
Gonzalo. Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,—
Antonio. He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.
Sebastian. Or docks, or mallows.
Gonzalo. And were the king on't, what would I do?
Sebastian. 'Scape being drunk for want of wine. 855
Gonzalo. I' the commonwealth I would by contraries 
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic 
Would I admit; no name of magistrate; 
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty, 
And use of service, none; contract, succession, 860
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none; 
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil; 
No occupation; all men idle, all; 
And women too, but innocent and pure; 
No sovereignty;— 865
Sebastian. Yet he would be king on't.
Antonio. The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the 
beginning.
Gonzalo. All things in common nature should produce 
Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony, 870
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine, 
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth, 
Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance, 
To feed my innocent people.
Sebastian. No marrying 'mong his subjects? 875
Antonio. None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.
Gonzalo. I would with such perfection govern, sir, 
To excel the golden age.
Sebastian. God save his majesty!
Antonio. Long live Gonzalo! 880
Gonzalo. And,—do you mark me, sir?
Alonso. Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.
Gonzalo. I do well believe your highness; and 
did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen, 
who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that 885
they always use to laugh at nothing.
Antonio. 'Twas you we laughed at.
Gonzalo. Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing 
to you: so you may continue and laugh at 
nothing still. 890
Antonio. What a blow was there given!
Sebastian. An it had not fallen flat-long.
Gonzalo. You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift 
the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue 
in it five weeks without changing. 895
[Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music]

Sebastian. We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.
Antonio. Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
Gonzalo. No, I warrant you; I will not adventure 
my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh 900
me asleep, for I am very heavy?
Antonio. Go sleep, and hear us.
[All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO]

Alonso. What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes 
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find 905
They are inclined to do so.
Sebastian. Please you, sir, 
Do not omit the heavy offer of it: 
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth, 
It is a comforter. 910
Antonio. We two, my lord, 
Will guard your person while you take your rest, 
And watch your safety.
Alonso. Thank you. Wondrous heavy.
[ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL]

Sebastian. What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
Antonio. It is the quality o' the climate.
Sebastian. Why 
Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not 
Myself disposed to sleep. 920
Antonio. Nor I; my spirits are nimble. 
They fell together all, as by consent; 
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might, 
Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?—No more:— 
And yet me thinks I see it in thy face, 925
What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and 
My strong imagination sees a crown 
Dropping upon thy head.
Sebastian. What, art thou waking?
Antonio. Do you not hear me speak? 930
Sebastian. I do; and surely 
It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st 
Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say? 
This is a strange repose, to be asleep 
With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving, 935
And yet so fast asleep.
Antonio. Noble Sebastian, 
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep—die, rather; wink'st 
Whiles thou art waking.
Sebastian. Thou dost snore distinctly; 940
There's meaning in thy snores.
Antonio. I am more serious than my custom: you 
Must be so too, if heed me; which to do 
Trebles thee o'er.
Sebastian. Well, I am standing water. 945
Antonio. I'll teach you how to flow.
Sebastian. Do so: to ebb 
Hereditary sloth instructs me.
Antonio. O, 
If you but knew how you the purpose cherish 950
Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it, 
You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed, 
Most often do so near the bottom run 
By their own fear or sloth.
Sebastian. Prithee, say on: 955
The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim 
A matter from thee, and a birth indeed 
Which throes thee much to yield.
Antonio. Thus, sir: 
Although this lord of weak remembrance, this, 960
Who shall be of as little memory 
When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,— 
For he's a spirit of persuasion, only 
Professes to persuade,—the king his son's alive, 
'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd 965
And he that sleeps here swims.
Sebastian. I have no hope 
That he's undrown'd.
Antonio. O, out of that 'no hope' 
What great hope have you! no hope that way is 970
Another way so high a hope that even 
Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond, 
But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me 
That Ferdinand is drown'd?
Sebastian. He's gone. 975
Antonio. Then, tell me, 
Who's the next heir of Naples?
Sebastian. Claribel.
Antonio. She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells 
Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples 980
Can have no note, unless the sun were post— 
The man i' the moon's too slow—till new-born chins 
Be rough and razorable; she that—from whom? 
We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again, 
And by that destiny to perform an act 985
Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come 
In yours and my discharge.
Sebastian. What stuff is this! how say you? 
'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis; 
So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions 990
There is some space.
Antonio. A space whose every cubit 
Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel 
Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis, 
And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death 995
That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse 
Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples 
As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate 
As amply and unnecessarily 
As this Gonzalo; I myself could make 1000
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore 
The mind that I do! what a sleep were this 
For your advancement! Do you understand me?
Sebastian. Methinks I do.
Antonio. And how does your content 1005
Tender your own good fortune?
Sebastian. I remember 
You did supplant your brother Prospero.
Antonio. True: 
And look how well my garments sit upon me; 1010
Much feater than before: my brother's servants 
Were then my fellows; now they are my men.
Sebastian. But, for your conscience?
Antonio. Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe, 
'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not 1015
This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences, 
That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they 
And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother, 
No better than the earth he lies upon, 
If he were that which now he's like, that's dead; 1020
Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it, 
Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus, 
To the perpetual wink for aye might put 
This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who 
Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest, 1025
They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk; 
They'll tell the clock to any business that 
We say befits the hour.
Sebastian. Thy case, dear friend, 
Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan, 1030
I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke 
Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest; 
And I the king shall love thee.
Antonio. Draw together; 
And when I rear my hand, do you the like, 1035
To fall it on Gonzalo.
Sebastian. O, but one word.
[They talk apart]

[Re-enter ARIEL, invisible]

Ariel. My master through his art foresees the danger 1040
That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth— 
For else his project dies—to keep them living. 
[Sings in GONZALO's ear] 
While you here do snoring lie, 
Open-eyed conspiracy 1045
His time doth take. 
If of life you keep a care, 
Shake off slumber, and beware: 
Awake, awake!
Antonio. Then let us both be sudden. 1050
Gonzalo. Now, good angels 
Preserve the king.
[They wake]

Alonso. Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn? 
Wherefore this ghastly looking? 1055
Gonzalo. What's the matter?
Sebastian. Whiles we stood here securing your repose, 
Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing 
Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you? 
It struck mine ear most terribly. 1060
Alonso. I heard nothing.
Antonio. O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear, 
To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar 
Of a whole herd of lions.
Alonso. Heard you this, Gonzalo? 1065
Gonzalo. Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming, 
And that a strange one too, which did awake me: 
I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd, 
I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise, 
That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard, 1070
Or that we quit this place; let's draw our weapons.
Alonso. Lead off this ground; and let's make further search 
For my poor son.
Gonzalo. Heavens keep him from these beasts! 
For he is, sure, i' the island. 1075
Alonso. Lead away.
Ariel. Prospero my lord shall know what I have done: 
So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.
[Exeunt]

 	     	
Act II, Scene 2

Another part of the island.

     	 
[Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of] [p]thunder heard]

Caliban. All the infections that the sun sucks up 
From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him 
By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me 
And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch, 1085
Fright me with urchin—shows, pitch me i' the mire, 
Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark 
Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but 
For every trifle are they set upon me; 
Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me 1090
And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which 
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount 
Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I 
All wound with adders who with cloven tongues 
Do hiss me into madness. 1095
[Enter TRINCULO] 
Lo, now, lo! 
Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me 
For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat; 
Perchance he will not mind me. 1100
Trinculo. Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off 
any weather at all, and another storm brewing; 
I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black 
cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul 
bombard that would shed his liquor. If it 1105
should thunder as it did before, I know not 
where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot 
choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we 
here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish: 
he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish- 1110
like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor- 
John. A strange fish! Were I in England now, 
as once I was, and had but this fish painted, 
not a holiday fool there but would give a piece 
of silver: there would this monster make a 1115
man; any strange beast there makes a man: 
when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame 
beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead 
Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like 
arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose 1120
my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish, 
but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a 
thunderbolt. 
[Thunder] 
Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is to 1125
creep under his gaberdine; there is no other 
shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with 
strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the 
dregs of the storm be past.
[Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his hand]

Stephano. I shall no more to sea, to sea, 
Here shall I die ashore— 
This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's 
funeral: well, here's my comfort. [Drinks] 
[Sings] 1135
The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I, 
The gunner and his mate 
Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery, 
But none of us cared for Kate; 
For she had a tongue with a tang, 1140
Would cry to a sailor, Go hang! 
She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch, 
Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch: 
Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang! 
This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort. 1145
[Drinks]

Caliban. Do not torment me: Oh!
Stephano. What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put 
tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind, ha? I 
have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your 1150
four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as 
ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground; 
and it shall be said so again while Stephano 
breathes at's nostrils.
Caliban. The spirit torments me; Oh! 1155
Stephano. This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who 
hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil 
should he learn our language? I will give him some 
relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him 
and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a 1160
present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.
Caliban. Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.
Stephano. He's in his fit now and does not talk after the 
wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have 
never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his 1165
fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will 
not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that 
hath him, and that soundly.
Caliban. Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I 
know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee. 1170
Stephano. Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that 
which will give language to you, cat: open your 
mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you, 
and that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend: 
open your chaps again. 1175
Trinculo. I should know that voice: it should be—but he is 
drowned; and these are devils: O defend me!
Stephano. Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster! 
His forward voice now is to speak well of his 
friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches 1180
and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will 
recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I 
will pour some in thy other mouth.
Trinculo. Stephano!
Stephano. Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This is 1185
a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have no 
long spoon.
Trinculo. Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me and 
speak to me: for I am Trinculo—be not afeard—thy 
good friend Trinculo. 1190
Stephano. If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull thee 
by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo's legs, 
these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How 
camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can 
he vent Trinculos? 1195
Trinculo. I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But 
art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art 
not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me 
under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of 
the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O 1200
Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!
Stephano. Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.
Caliban. [Aside] These be fine things, an if they be 
not sprites. 
That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor. 1205
I will kneel to him.
Stephano. How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither? 
swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I 
escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors 
heaved o'erboard, by this bottle; which I made of 1210
the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was 
cast ashore.
Caliban. I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject; 
for the liquor is not earthly.
Stephano. Here; swear then how thou escapedst. 1215
Trinculo. Swum ashore. man, like a duck: I can swim like a 
duck, I'll be sworn.
Stephano. Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a 
duck, thou art made like a goose.
Trinculo. O Stephano. hast any more of this? 1220
Stephano. The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by the 
sea-side where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf! 
how does thine ague?
Caliban. Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?
Stephano. Out o' the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i' 1225
the moon when time was.
Caliban. I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee: 
My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.
Stephano. Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish 
it anon with new contents swear. 1230
Trinculo. By this good light, this is a very shallow monster! 
I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The man i' 
the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well 
drawn, monster, in good sooth!
Caliban. I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island; 1235
And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.
Trinculo. By this light, a most perfidious and drunken 
monster! when 's god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle.
Caliban. I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.
Stephano. Come on then; down, and swear. 1240
Trinculo. I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed 
monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my 
heart to beat him,—
Stephano. Come, kiss.
Trinculo. But that the poor monster's in drink: an abominable monster! 1245
Caliban. I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries; 
I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough. 
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve! 
I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee, 
Thou wondrous man. 1250
Trinculo. A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a 
Poor drunkard!
Caliban. I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow; 
And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts; 
Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how 1255
To snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring thee 
To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee 
Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?
Stephano. I prithee now, lead the way without any more 
talking. Trinculo, the king and all our company 1260
else being drowned, we will inherit here: here; 
bear my bottle: fellow Trinculo, we'll fill him by 
and by again.
Caliban. [Sings drunkenly] 
Farewell master; farewell, farewell! 1265
Trinculo. A howling monster: a drunken monster!
Caliban. No more dams I'll make for fish 
Nor fetch in firing 
At requiring; 
Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish 1270
'Ban, 'Ban, Cacaliban 
Has a new master: get a new man. 
Freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom, 
hey-day, freedom!
Stephano. O brave monster! Lead the way. 1275

Act III, Scene 1

Before PROSPERO’S Cell.

     	 
[Enter FERDINAND, bearing a log]

Ferdinand. There be some sports are painful, and their labour 
Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness 
Are nobly undergone and most poor matters 1280
Point to rich ends. This my mean task 
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but 
The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead 
And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is 
Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed, 1285
And he's composed of harshness. I must remove 
Some thousands of these logs and pile them up, 
Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress 
Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness 
Had never like executor. I forget: 1290
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours, 
Most busy lest, when I do it.
[Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen]

Miranda. Alas, now, pray you, 
Work not so hard: I would the lightning had 1295
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile! 
Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns, 
'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father 
Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself; 
He's safe for these three hours. 1300
Ferdinand. O most dear mistress, 
The sun will set before I shall discharge 
What I must strive to do.
Miranda. If you'll sit down, 
I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that; 1305
I'll carry it to the pile.
Ferdinand. No, precious creature; 
I had rather crack my sinews, break my back, 
Than you should such dishonour undergo, 
While I sit lazy by. 1310
Miranda. It would become me 
As well as it does you: and I should do it 
With much more ease; for my good will is to it, 
And yours it is against.
Prospero. Poor worm, thou art infected! 1315
This visitation shows it.
Miranda. You look wearily.
Ferdinand. No, noble mistress;'tis fresh morning with me 
When you are by at night. I do beseech you— 
Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers— 1320
What is your name?
Miranda. Miranda.—O my father, 
I have broke your hest to say so!
Ferdinand. Admired Miranda! 
Indeed the top of admiration! worth 1325
What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady 
I have eyed with best regard and many a time 
The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage 
Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues 
Have I liked several women; never any 1330
With so fun soul, but some defect in her 
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed 
And put it to the foil: but you, O you, 
So perfect and so peerless, are created 
Of every creature's best! 1335
Miranda. I do not know 
One of my sex; no woman's face remember, 
Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen 
More that I may call men than you, good friend, 
And my dear father: how features are abroad, 1340
I am skilless of; but, by my modesty, 
The jewel in my dower, I would not wish 
Any companion in the world but you, 
Nor can imagination form a shape, 
Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle 1345
Something too wildly and my father's precepts 
I therein do forget.
Ferdinand. I am in my condition 
A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king; 
I would, not so!—and would no more endure 1350
This wooden slavery than to suffer 
The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak: 
The very instant that I saw you, did 
My heart fly to your service; there resides, 
To make me slave to it; and for your sake 1355
Am I this patient log—man.
Miranda. Do you love me?
Ferdinand. O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound 
And crown what I profess with kind event 
If I speak true! if hollowly, invert 1360
What best is boded me to mischief! I 
Beyond all limit of what else i' the world 
Do love, prize, honour you.
Miranda. I am a fool 
To weep at what I am glad of. 1365
Prospero. Fair encounter 
Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace 
On that which breeds between 'em!
Ferdinand. Wherefore weep you?
Miranda. At mine unworthiness that dare not offer 1370
What I desire to give, and much less take 
What I shall die to want. But this is trifling; 
And all the more it seeks to hide itself, 
The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning! 
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence! 1375
I am your wife, it you will marry me; 
If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow 
You may deny me; but I'll be your servant, 
Whether you will or no.
Ferdinand. My mistress, dearest; 1380
And I thus humble ever.
Miranda. My husband, then?
Ferdinand. Ay, with a heart as willing 
As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.
Miranda. And mine, with my heart in't; and now farewell 1385
Till half an hour hence.
Ferdinand. A thousand thousand!
[Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally]

Prospero. So glad of this as they I cannot be, 
Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing 1390
At nothing can be more. I'll to my book, 
For yet ere supper-time must I perform 
Much business appertaining.
[Exit]

 	     	
Act III, Scene 2

Another part of the island.

     	 
[Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO]

Stephano. Tell not me; when the butt is out, we will drink 
water; not a drop before: therefore bear up, and 
board 'em. Servant-monster, drink to me.
Trinculo. Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They 
say there's but five upon this isle: we are three 1400
of them; if th' other two be brained like us, the 
state totters.
Stephano. Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes 
are almost set in thy head.
Trinculo. Where should they be set else? he were a brave 1405
monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.
Stephano. My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack: 
for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I 
could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off 
and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant, 1410
monster, or my standard.
Trinculo. Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.
Stephano. We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.
Trinculo. Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet say 
nothing neither. 1415
Stephano. Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a 
good moon-calf.
Caliban. How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe. 
I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.
Trinculo. Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to 1420
justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou, 
was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much 
sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, 
being but half a fish and half a monster?
Caliban. Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord? 1425
Trinculo. 'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!
Caliban. Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.
Stephano. Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you 
prove a mutineer,—the next tree! The poor monster's 
my subject and he shall not suffer indignity. 1430
Caliban. I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to 
hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?
Stephano. Marry, will I. kneel and repeat it; I will stand, 
and so shall Trinculo.
[Enter ARIEL, invisible]

Caliban. As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a 
sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.
Ariel. Thou liest.
Caliban. Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou: I would my 
valiant master would destroy thee! I do not lie. 1440
Stephano. Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, by 
this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.
Trinculo. Why, I said nothing.
Stephano. Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.
Caliban. I say, by sorcery he got this isle; 1445
From me he got it. if thy greatness will 
Revenge it on him,—for I know thou darest, 
But this thing dare not,—
Stephano. That's most certain.
Caliban. Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee. 1450
Stephano. How now shall this be compassed? 
Canst thou bring me to the party?
Caliban. Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep, 
Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.
Ariel. Thou liest; thou canst not. 1455
Caliban. What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch! 
I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows 
And take his bottle from him: when that's gone 
He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him 
Where the quick freshes are. 1460
Stephano. Trinculo, run into no further danger: 
interrupt the monster one word further, and, 
by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors 
and make a stock-fish of thee.
Trinculo. Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther 1465
off.
Stephano. Didst thou not say he lied?
Ariel. Thou liest.
Stephano. Do I so? take thou that. 
[Beats TRINCULO] 1470
As you like this, give me the lie another time.
Trinculo. I did not give the lie. Out o' your 
wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle! 
this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on 
your monster, and the devil take your fingers! 1475
Caliban. Ha, ha, ha!
Stephano. Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther 
off.
Caliban. Beat him enough: after a little time 
I'll beat him too. 1480
Stephano. Stand farther. Come, proceed.
Caliban. Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him, 
I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him, 
Having first seized his books, or with a log 
Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake, 1485
Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember 
First to possess his books; for without them 
He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not 
One spirit to command: they all do hate him 
As rootedly as I. Burn but his books. 1490
He has brave utensils,—for so he calls them— 
Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal 
And that most deeply to consider is 
The beauty of his daughter; he himself 
Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman, 1495
But only Sycorax my dam and she; 
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax 
As great'st does least.
Stephano. Is it so brave a lass?
Caliban. Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant. 1500
And bring thee forth brave brood.
Stephano. Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I 
will be king and queen—save our graces!—and 
Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou 
like the plot, Trinculo? 1505
Trinculo. Excellent.
Stephano. Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but, 
while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.
Caliban. Within this half hour will he be asleep: 
Wilt thou destroy him then? 1510
Stephano. Ay, on mine honour.
Ariel. This will I tell my master.
Caliban. Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure: 
Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch 
You taught me but while-ere? 1515
Stephano. At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any 
reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing. 
[Sings] 
Flout 'em and scout 'em 
And scout 'em and flout 'em 1520
Thought is free.
Caliban. That's not the tune.
[Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe]

Stephano. What is this same?
Trinculo. This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture 1525
of Nobody.
Stephano. If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness: 
if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.
Trinculo. O, forgive me my sins!
Stephano. He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us! 1530
Caliban. Art thou afeard?
Stephano. No, monster, not I.
Caliban. Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises, 
Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not. 
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments 1535
Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices 
That, if I then had waked after long sleep, 
Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming, 
The clouds methought would open and show riches 
Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked, 1540
I cried to dream again.
Stephano. This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall 
have my music for nothing.
Caliban. When Prospero is destroyed.
Stephano. That shall be by and by: I remember the story. 1545
Trinculo. The sound is going away; let's follow it, and 
after do our work.
Stephano. Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could see 
this tabourer; he lays it on.
Trinculo. Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano. 1550
[Exeunt]

 	     	
Act III, Scene 3

Another part of the island.

     	 
[Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO,] [p]ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others]

Gonzalo. By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir; 
My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed 1555
Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience, 
I needs must rest me.
Alonso. Old lord, I cannot blame thee, 
Who am myself attach'd with weariness, 
To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest. 1560
Even here I will put off my hope and keep it 
No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd 
Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks 
Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.
Antonio. [Aside to SEBASTIAN] I am right glad that he's so 1565
out of hope. 
Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose 
That you resolved to effect.
Sebastian. [Aside to ANTONIO] The next advantage 
Will we take throughly. 1570
Antonio. [Aside to SEBASTIAN] Let it be to-night; 
For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they 
Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance 
As when they are fresh.
Sebastian. [Aside to ANTONIO] I say, to-night: no more. 1575
[Solemn and strange music]

Alonso. What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!
Gonzalo. Marvellous sweet music! 
[Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several] 
strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet; 1580
they dance about it with gentle actions of 
salutation; and, inviting the King, &c. to 
eat, they depart]
Alonso. Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?
Sebastian. A living drollery. Now I will believe 1585
That there are unicorns, that in Arabia 
There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix 
At this hour reigning there.
Antonio. I'll believe both; 
And what does else want credit, come to me, 1590
And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did 
lie, 
Though fools at home condemn 'em.
Gonzalo. If in Naples 
I should report this now, would they believe me? 1595
If I should say, I saw such islanders— 
For, certes, these are people of the island— 
Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note, 
Their manners are more gentle-kind than of 
Our human generation you shall find 1600
Many, nay, almost any.
Prospero. [Aside] Honest lord, 
Thou hast said well; for some of you there present 
Are worse than devils.
Alonso. I cannot too much muse 1605
Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing, 
Although they want the use of tongue, a kind 
Of excellent dumb discourse.
Prospero. [Aside]. Praise in departing.
Francisco. They vanish'd strangely. 1610
Sebastian. No matter, since 
They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs. 
Will't please you taste of what is here?
Alonso. Not I.
Gonzalo. Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys, 1615
Who would believe that there were mountaineers 
Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em 
Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men 
Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find 
Each putter-out of five for one will bring us 1620
Good warrant of.
Alonso. I will stand to and feed, 
Although my last: no matter, since I feel 
The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke, 
Stand to and do as we. 1625
[Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a] 
harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and, 
with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes]
Ariel. You are three men of sin, whom Destiny, 
That hath to instrument this lower world 1630
And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea 
Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island 
Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men 
Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad; 
And even with such-like valour men hang and drown 1635
Their proper selves. 
[ALONSO, SEBASTIAN &c. draw their swords] 
You fools! I and my fellows 
Are ministers of Fate: the elements, 
Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well 1640
Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs 
Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish 
One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers 
Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt, 
Your swords are now too massy for your strengths 1645
And will not be uplifted. But remember— 
For that's my business to you—that you three 
From Milan did supplant good Prospero; 
Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it, 
Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed 1650
The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have 
Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures, 
Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso, 
They have bereft; and do pronounce by me: 
Lingering perdition, worse than any death 1655
Can be at once, shall step by step attend 
You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from— 
Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls 
Upon your heads—is nothing but heart-sorrow 
And a clear life ensuing. 1660
[He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music] 
enter the Shapes again, and dance, with 
mocks and mows, and carrying out the table]
Prospero. Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou 
Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring: 1665
Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated 
In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life 
And observation strange, my meaner ministers 
Their several kinds have done. My high charms work 
And these mine enemies are all knit up 1670
In their distractions; they now are in my power; 
And in these fits I leave them, while I visit 
Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd, 
And his and mine loved darling.
[Exit above]

Gonzalo. I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you 
In this strange stare?
Alonso. O, it is monstrous, monstrous: 
Methought the billows spoke and told me of it; 
The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder, 1680
That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced 
The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass. 
Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and 
I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded 
And with him there lie mudded. 1685
[Exit]

Sebastian. But one fiend at a time, 
I'll fight their legions o'er.
Antonio. I'll be thy second.
[Exeunt SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO]

Gonzalo. All three of them are desperate: their great guilt, 
Like poison given to work a great time after, 
Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you 
That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly 
And hinder them from what this ecstasy 1695
May now provoke them to.
Adrian. Follow, I pray you.
[Exeunt]

 	     	
Act IV, Scene 1

Before PROSPERO’S cell.

     	 
[Enter PROSPERO, FERDINAND, and MIRANDA]

Prospero. If I have too austerely punish'd you, 1700
Your compensation makes amends, for I 
Have given you here a third of mine own life, 
Or that for which I live; who once again 
I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations 
Were but my trials of thy love and thou 1705
Hast strangely stood the test here, afore Heaven, 
I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand, 
Do not smile at me that I boast her off, 
For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise 
And make it halt behind her. 1710
Ferdinand. I do believe it 
Against an oracle.
Prospero. Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition 
Worthily purchased take my daughter: but 
If thou dost break her virgin-knot before 1715
All sanctimonious ceremonies may 
With full and holy rite be minister'd, 
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall 
To make this contract grow: but barren hate, 
Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew 1720
The union of your bed with weeds so loathly 
That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed, 
As Hymen's lamps shall light you.
Ferdinand. As I hope 
For quiet days, fair issue and long life, 1725
With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den, 
The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion. 
Our worser genius can, shall never melt 
Mine honour into lust, to take away 
The edge of that day's celebration 1730
When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd, 
Or Night kept chain'd below.
Prospero. Fairly spoke. 
Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own. 
What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel! 1735
[Enter ARIEL]

Ariel. What would my potent master? here I am.
Prospero. Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service 
Did worthily perform; and I must use you 
In such another trick. Go bring the rabble, 1740
O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place: 
Incite them to quick motion; for I must 
Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple 
Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise, 
And they expect it from me. 1745
Ariel. Presently?
Prospero. Ay, with a twink.
Ariel. Before you can say 'come' and 'go,' 
And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,' 
Each one, tripping on his toe, 1750
Will be here with mop and mow. 
Do you love me, master? no?
Prospero. Dearly my delicate Ariel. Do not approach 
Till thou dost hear me call.
Ariel. Well, I conceive. 1755
[Exit]

Prospero. Look thou be true; do not give dalliance 
Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw 
To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious, 
Or else, good night your vow! 1760
Ferdinand. I warrant you sir; 
The white cold virgin snow upon my heart 
Abates the ardour of my liver.
Prospero. Well. 
Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary, 1765
Rather than want a spirit: appear and pertly! 
No tongue! all eyes! be silent.
[Soft music]

[Enter IRIS]

Iris. Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas 1770
Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease; 
Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep, 
And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep; 
Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims, 
Which spongy April at thy hest betrims, 1775
To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom -groves, 
Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves, 
Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard; 
And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard, 
Where thou thyself dost air;—the queen o' the sky, 1780
Whose watery arch and messenger am I, 
Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace, 
Here on this grass-plot, in this very place, 
To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain: 
Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain. 1785
[Enter CERES]

Ceres. Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er 
Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter; 
Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers 
Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers, 1790
And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown 
My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down, 
Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen 
Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?
Iris. A contract of true love to celebrate; 1795
And some donation freely to estate 
On the blest lovers.
Ceres. Tell me, heavenly bow, 
If Venus or her son, as thou dost know, 
Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot 1800
The means that dusky Dis my daughter got, 
Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company 
I have forsworn.
Iris. Of her society 
Be not afraid: I met her deity 1805
Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son 
Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done 
Some wanton charm upon this man and maid, 
Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid 
Till Hymen's torch be lighted: but vain; 1810
Mars's hot minion is returned again; 
Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows, 
Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows 
And be a boy right out.
Ceres. High'st queen of state, 1815
Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.
[Enter JUNO]

Juno. How does my bounteous sister? Go with me 
To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be 
And honour'd in their issue. 1820
[They sing:]

Juno. Honour, riches, marriage-blessing, 
Long continuance, and increasing, 
Hourly joys be still upon you! 
Juno sings her blessings upon you. 1825
Ceres. Earth's increase, foison plenty, 
Barns and garners never empty, 
Vines and clustering bunches growing, 
Plants with goodly burthen bowing; 
Spring come to you at the farthest 1830
In the very end of harvest! 
Scarcity and want shall shun you; 
Ceres' blessing so is on you.
Ferdinand. This is a most majestic vision, and 
Harmoniously charmingly. May I be bold 1835
To think these spirits?
Prospero. Spirits, which by mine art 
I have from their confines call'd to enact 
My present fancies.
Ferdinand. Let me live here ever; 1840
So rare a wonder'd father and a wife 
Makes this place Paradise. 
[Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on] 
employment]
Prospero. Sweet, now, silence! 1845
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously; 
There's something else to do: hush, and be mute, 
Or else our spell is marr'd.
Iris. You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the windring brooks, 
With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks, 1850
Leave your crisp channels and on this green land 
Answer your summons; Juno does command: 
Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate 
A contract of true love; be not too late. 
[Enter certain Nymphs] 1855
You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary, 
Come hither from the furrow and be merry: 
Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on 
And these fresh nymphs encounter every one 
In country footing. 1860
[Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they] 
join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance; 
towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts 
suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a 
strange, hollow, and confused noise, they 1865
heavily vanish]
Prospero. [Aside] I had forgot that foul conspiracy 
Of the beast Caliban and his confederates 
Against my life: the minute of their plot 
Is almost come. 1870
[To the Spirits] 
Well done! avoid; no more!
Ferdinand. This is strange: your father's in some passion 
That works him strongly.
Miranda. Never till this day 1875
Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.
Prospero. You do look, my son, in a moved sort, 
As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir. 
Our revels now are ended. These our actors, 
As I foretold you, were all spirits and 1880
Are melted into air, into thin air: 
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision, 
The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, 
The solemn temples, the great globe itself, 
Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve 1885
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, 
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff 
As dreams are made on, and our little life 
Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd; 
Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled: 1890
Be not disturb'd with my infirmity: 
If you be pleased, retire into my cell 
And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk, 
To still my beating mind.
Ferdinand. [with Miranda] We wish your peace. 1895
[Exeunt]

Prospero. Come with a thought I thank thee, Ariel: come.
[Enter ARIEL]

Ariel. Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?
Prospero. Spirit, 1900
We must prepare to meet with Caliban.
Ariel. Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres, 
I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd 
Lest I might anger thee.
Prospero. Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets? 1905
Ariel. I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking; 
So fun of valour that they smote the air 
For breathing in their faces; beat the ground 
For kissing of their feet; yet always bending 
Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour; 1910
At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd 
their ears, 
Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses 
As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears 
That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through 1915
Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns, 
Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them 
I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell, 
There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake 
O'erstunk their feet. 1920
Prospero. This was well done, my bird. 
Thy shape invisible retain thou still: 
The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither, 
For stale to catch these thieves.
Ariel. I go, I go. 1925
[Exit]

Prospero. A devil, a born devil, on whose nature 
Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains, 
Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost; 
And as with age his body uglier grows, 1930
So his mind cankers. I will plague them all, 
Even to roaring. 
[Re-enter ARIEL, loaden with glistering apparel, &c] 
Come, hang them on this line. 
[PROSPERO and ARIEL remain invisible. Enter] 1935
CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, all wet]
Caliban. Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not 
Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.
Stephano. Monster, your fairy, which you say is 
a harmless fairy, has done little better than 1940
played the Jack with us.
Trinculo. Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at 
which my nose is in great indignation.
Stephano. So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take 
a displeasure against you, look you,— 1945
Trinculo. Thou wert but a lost monster.
Caliban. Good my lord, give me thy favour still. 
Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to 
Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly. 
All's hush'd as midnight yet. 1950
Trinculo. Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,—
Stephano. There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that, 
monster, but an infinite loss.
Trinculo. That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your 
harmless fairy, monster. 1955
Stephano. I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears 
for my labour.
Caliban. Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here, 
This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter. 
Do that good mischief which may make this island 1960
Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban, 
For aye thy foot-licker.
Stephano. Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.
Trinculo. O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look 
what a wardrobe here is for thee! 1965
Caliban. Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.
Trinculo. O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery. 
O king Stephano!
Stephano. Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll have 
that gown. 1970
Trinculo. Thy grace shall have it.
Caliban. The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean 
To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone 
And do the murder first: if he awake, 
From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches, 1975
Make us strange stuff.
Stephano. Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line, 
is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under 
the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your 
hair and prove a bald jerkin. 1980
Trinculo. Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace.
Stephano. I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't: 
wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this 
country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent 
pass of pate; there's another garment for't. 1985
Trinculo. Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and 
away with the rest.
Caliban. I will have none on't: we shall lose our time, 
And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes 
With foreheads villanous low. 1990
Stephano. Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this 
away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you 
out of my kingdom: go to, carry this.
Trinculo. And this.
Stephano. Ay, and this. 1995
[A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits,] 
in shape of dogs and hounds, and hunt them about, 
PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on]
Prospero. Hey, Mountain, hey!
Ariel. Silver I there it goes, Silver! 2000
Prospero. Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark! 
[CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, are] 
driven out] 
Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints 
With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews 2005
With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them 
Than pard or cat o' mountain.
Ariel. Hark, they roar!
Prospero. Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour 
Lie at my mercy all mine enemies: 2010
Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou 
Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little 
Follow, and do me service.
[Exeunt]

 	     	
Act V, Scene 1

Before PROSPERO’S cell.

     	 
[Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL]

Prospero. Now does my project gather to a head: 
My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time 
Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?
Ariel. On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord, 
You said our work should cease. 2020
Prospero. I did say so, 
When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit, 
How fares the king and's followers?
Ariel. Confined together 
In the same fashion as you gave in charge, 2025
Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir, 
In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell; 
They cannot budge till your release. The king, 
His brother and yours, abide all three distracted 
And the remainder mourning over them, 2030
Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly 
Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;' 
His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops 
From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em 
That if you now beheld them, your affections 2035
Would become tender.
Prospero. Dost thou think so, spirit?
Ariel. Mine would, sir, were I human.
Prospero. And mine shall. 
Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling 2040
Of their afflictions, and shall not myself, 
One of their kind, that relish all as sharply, 
Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art? 
Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick, 
Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury 2045
Do I take part: the rarer action is 
In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent, 
The sole drift of my purpose doth extend 
Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel: 
My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore, 2050
And they shall be themselves.
Ariel. I'll fetch them, sir.
[Exit]

Prospero. Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves, 
And ye that on the sands with printless foot 2055
Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him 
When he comes back; you demi-puppets that 
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make, 
Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime 
Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice 2060
To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid, 
Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd 
The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds, 
And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault 
Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder 2065
Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak 
With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory 
Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up 
The pine and cedar: graves at my command 
Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth 2070
By my so potent art. But this rough magic 
I here abjure, and, when I have required 
Some heavenly music, which even now I do, 
To work mine end upon their senses that 
This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff, 2075
Bury it certain fathoms in the earth, 
And deeper than did ever plummet sound 
I'll drown my book. 
[Solemn music] 
[Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a] 2080
frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO; 
SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner, 
attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO they all 
enter the circle which PROSPERO had made, 
and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO 2085
observing, speaks:] 
A solemn air and the best comforter 
To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains, 
Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand, 
For you are spell-stopp'd. 2090
Holy Gonzalo, honourable man, 
Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine, 
Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace, 
And as the morning steals upon the night, 
Melting the darkness, so their rising senses 2095
Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle 
Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo, 
My true preserver, and a loyal sir 
To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces 
Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly 2100
Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter: 
Thy brother was a furtherer in the act. 
Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood, 
You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition, 
Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian, 2105
Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong, 
Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee, 
Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding 
Begins to swell, and the approaching tide 
Will shortly fill the reasonable shore 2110
That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them 
That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel, 
Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell: 
I will discase me, and myself present 
As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit; 2115
Thou shalt ere long be free. 
[ARIEL sings and helps to attire him] 
Where the bee sucks. there suck I: 
In a cowslip's bell I lie; 
There I couch when owls do cry. 2120
On the bat's back I do fly 
After summer merrily. 
Merrily, merrily shall I live now 
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
Prospero. Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee: 2125
But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so. 
To the king's ship, invisible as thou art: 
There shalt thou find the mariners asleep 
Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain 
Being awake, enforce them to this place, 2130
And presently, I prithee.
Ariel. I drink the air before me, and return 
Or ere your pulse twice beat.
[Exit]

Gonzalo. All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement 2135
Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us 
Out of this fearful country!
Prospero. Behold, sir king, 
The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero: 
For more assurance that a living prince 2140
Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body; 
And to thee and thy company I bid 
A hearty welcome.
Alonso. Whether thou best he or no, 
Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me, 2145
As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse 
Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee, 
The affliction of my mind amends, with which, 
I fear, a madness held me: this must crave, 
An if this be at all, a most strange story. 2150
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat 
Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero 
Be living and be here?
Prospero. First, noble friend, 
Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot 2155
Be measured or confined.
Gonzalo. Whether this be 
Or be not, I'll not swear.
Prospero. You do yet taste 
Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you 2160
Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all! 
[Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO] 
But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded, 
I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you 
And justify you traitors: at this time 2165
I will tell no tales.
Sebastian. [Aside] The devil speaks in him.
Prospero. No. 
For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother 
Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive 2170
Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require 
My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know, 
Thou must restore.
Alonso. If thou be'st Prospero, 
Give us particulars of thy preservation; 2175
How thou hast met us here, who three hours since 
Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost— 
How sharp the point of this remembrance is!— 
My dear son Ferdinand.
Prospero. I am woe for't, sir. 2180
Alonso. Irreparable is the loss, and patience 
Says it is past her cure.
Prospero. I rather think 
You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace 
For the like loss I have her sovereign aid 2185
And rest myself content.
Alonso. You the like loss!
Prospero. As great to me as late; and, supportable 
To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker 
Than you may call to comfort you, for I 2190
Have lost my daughter.
Alonso. A daughter? 
O heavens, that they were living both in Naples, 
The king and queen there! that they were, I wish 
Myself were mudded in that oozy bed 2195
Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?
Prospero. In this last tempest. I perceive these lords 
At this encounter do so much admire 
That they devour their reason and scarce think 
Their eyes do offices of truth, their words 2200
Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have 
Been justled from your senses, know for certain 
That I am Prospero and that very duke 
Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely 
Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed, 2205
To be the lord on't. No more yet of this; 
For 'tis a chronicle of day by day, 
Not a relation for a breakfast nor 
Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir; 
This cell's my court: here have I few attendants 2210
And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in. 
My dukedom since you have given me again, 
I will requite you with as good a thing; 
At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye 
As much as me my dukedom. 2215
[Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA] 
playing at chess]
Miranda. Sweet lord, you play me false.
Ferdinand. No, my dear'st love, 
I would not for the world. 2220
Miranda. Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle, 
And I would call it, fair play.
Alonso. If this prove 
A vision of the Island, one dear son 
Shall I twice lose. 2225
Sebastian. A most high miracle!
Ferdinand. Though the seas threaten, they are merciful; 
I have cursed them without cause.
[Kneels]

Alonso. Now all the blessings 2230
Of a glad father compass thee about! 
Arise, and say how thou camest here.
Miranda. O, wonder! 
How many goodly creatures are there here! 
How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world, 2235
That has such people in't!
Prospero. 'Tis new to thee.
Alonso. What is this maid with whom thou wast at play? 
Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours: 
Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us, 2240
And brought us thus together?
Ferdinand. Sir, she is mortal; 
But by immortal Providence she's mine: 
I chose her when I could not ask my father 
For his advice, nor thought I had one. She 2245
Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan, 
Of whom so often I have heard renown, 
But never saw before; of whom I have 
Received a second life; and second father 
This lady makes him to me. 2250
Alonso. I am hers: 
But, O, how oddly will it sound that I 
Must ask my child forgiveness!
Prospero. There, sir, stop: 
Let us not burthen our remembrance with 2255
A heaviness that's gone.
Gonzalo. I have inly wept, 
Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god, 
And on this couple drop a blessed crown! 
For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way 2260
Which brought us hither.
Alonso. I say, Amen, Gonzalo!
Gonzalo. Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue 
Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice 
Beyond a common joy, and set it down 2265
With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage 
Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis, 
And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife 
Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom 
In a poor isle and all of us ourselves 2270
When no man was his own.
Alonso. [To FERDINAND and MIRANDA] Give me your hands: 
Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart 
That doth not wish you joy!
Gonzalo. Be it so! Amen! 2275
[Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain] 
amazedly following] 
O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us: 
I prophesied, if a gallows were on land, 
This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy, 2280
That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore? 
Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?
Boatswain. The best news is, that we have safely found 
Our king and company; the next, our ship— 
Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split— 2285
Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when 
We first put out to sea.
Ariel. [Aside to PROSPERO] Sir, all this service 
Have I done since I went.
Prospero. [Aside to ARIEL] My tricksy spirit! 2290
Alonso. These are not natural events; they strengthen 
From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?
Boatswain. If I did think, sir, I were well awake, 
I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep, 
And—how we know not—all clapp'd under hatches; 2295
Where but even now with strange and several noises 
Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains, 
And more diversity of sounds, all horrible, 
We were awaked; straightway, at liberty; 
Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld 2300
Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master 
Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you, 
Even in a dream, were we divided from them 
And were brought moping hither.
Ariel. [Aside to PROSPERO] Was't well done? 2305
Prospero. [Aside to ARIEL] Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.
Alonso. This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod 
And there is in this business more than nature 
Was ever conduct of: some oracle 
Must rectify our knowledge. 2310
Prospero. Sir, my liege, 
Do not infest your mind with beating on 
The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure 
Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you, 
Which to you shall seem probable, of every 2315
These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful 
And think of each thing well. 
[Aside to ARIEL] 
Come hither, spirit: 
Set Caliban and his companions free; 2320
Untie the spell. 
[Exit ARIEL] 
How fares my gracious sir? 
There are yet missing of your company 
Some few odd lads that you remember not. 2325
[Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO] 
and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel]
Stephano. Every man shift for all the rest, and 
let no man take care for himself; for all is 
but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio! 2330
Trinculo. If these be true spies which I wear in my head, 
here's a goodly sight.
Caliban. O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed! 
How fine my master is! I am afraid 
He will chastise me. 2335
Sebastian. Ha, ha! 
What things are these, my lord Antonio? 
Will money buy 'em?
Antonio. Very like; one of them 
Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable. 2340
Prospero. Mark but the badges of these men, my lords, 
Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave, 
His mother was a witch, and one so strong 
That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs, 
And deal in her command without her power. 2345
These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil— 
For he's a bastard one—had plotted with them 
To take my life. Two of these fellows you 
Must know and own; this thing of darkness I 
Acknowledge mine. 2350
Caliban. I shall be pinch'd to death.
Alonso. Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?
Sebastian. He is drunk now: where had he wine?
Alonso. And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they 
Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em? 2355
How camest thou in this pickle?
Trinculo. I have been in such a pickle since I 
saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of 
my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.
Sebastian. Why, how now, Stephano! 2360
Stephano. O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.
Prospero. You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?
Stephano. I should have been a sore one then.
Alonso. This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.
[Pointing to Caliban]

Prospero. He is as disproportion'd in his manners 
As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell; 
Take with you your companions; as you look 
To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.
Caliban. Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter 2370
And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass 
Was I, to take this drunkard for a god 
And worship this dull fool!
Prospero. Go to; away!
Alonso. Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it. 2375
Sebastian. Or stole it, rather.
[Exeunt CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO]

Prospero. Sir, I invite your highness and your train 
To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest 
For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste 2380
With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it 
Go quick away; the story of my life 
And the particular accidents gone by 
Since I came to this isle: and in the morn 
I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples, 2385
Where I have hope to see the nuptial 
Of these our dear-beloved solemnized; 
And thence retire me to my Milan, where 
Every third thought shall be my grave.
Alonso. I long 2390
To hear the story of your life, which must 
Take the ear strangely.
Prospero. I'll deliver all; 
And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales 
And sail so expeditious that shall catch 2395
Your royal fleet far off. 
[Aside to ARIEL] 
My Ariel, chick, 
That is thy charge: then to the elements 
Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near. 2400
[Exeunt] 
EPILOGUE
[Spoken by PROSPERO]

Prospero. Now my charms are all o'erthrown, 
And what strength I have's mine own, 2405
Which is most faint: now, 'tis true, 
I must be here confined by you, 
Or sent to Naples. Let me not, 
Since I have my dukedom got 
And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell 2410
In this bare island by your spell; 
But release me from my bands 
With the help of your good hands: 
Gentle breath of yours my sails 
Must fill, or else my project fails, 2415
Which was to please. Now I want 
Spirits to enforce, art to enchant, 
And my ending is despair, 
Unless I be relieved by prayer, 
Which pierces so that it assaults 2420
Mercy itself and frees all faults. 
As you from crimes would pardon'd be, 
Let your indulgence set me free.

AND THEN IN THE END THEY WOKE UP AND IT WAS ALL A DREAM
